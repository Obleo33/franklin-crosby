			<h3>Why Development:</h3>
			<p>Since a young age, I have been obsessed with puzzles, games and building. Itâ€™s safe to say I had an epic Lego collection. I love figuring out how things work and taking that knowledge to build new things. As a developer, I am constantly presented with new and challenging puzzles. It is my passion to draw from everything around me to fabricate a solution and work with others to bring ideas to life.
